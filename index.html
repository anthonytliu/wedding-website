            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <h3><em>What should I wear?</em></h3>
            <p>Please see “Dress” above. Feel free to send us any questions or outfit ideas!</p>
            <br>

            <h3><em>Can I bring a plus one?</em></h3>
            <p>Due to the intimate and interactive nature of our wedding, we’ve selected venues that have limited capacity. Every guest who is invited will be explicitly listed on the invitation.</p>
            <br>

            <h3><em>Gifts and Registry?</em></h3>
            <p>Your love and presence on our special day is truly the greatest gift we could ask for! If you feel compelled to give in the traditional sense, <a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/anthonyandmahal" target="_blank">we’ve put together a registry here.</a> Most of all, we’re just excited to celebrate with you! <br><br> For folks that appreciate a charitable donation option, please consider donating to these organizations on our behalf: <a href="https://www.sistersong.net/reproductive-justice" target="_blank">Sister Song</a> or <a href="https://goodkarmabikes.org/donate/" target="_blank">Good Karma Bikes</a></p>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3><em>Can I bring my children?</em></h3>
            <p>Similar to our answer to plus ones, only those who have invitations can attend.</p>
            <br>

            <h3><em>Will the venue be outdoors or indoors?</em></h3>
            <p>The ceremony will be indoors. The cocktail hour will be on a backyard patio. The dinner will be indoors. The after party will be at a brewery with both indoor and outdoor seating. Bring layers!</p>
            <br>

            <!-- <h3><em>Accessibility</em></h3>
            <p>The Sunnyside Conservatory address we’ve linked directs to a street address with a few not-too-steep stairs along with handrails. If you are more comfortable using a ramp, we highly recommend routing to the Sunnyside Conservatory main entrance at 236 Monterey Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94131.</p>
            <br> -->

            <h3><em>Will there be parking?</em></h3>
            <p>No, unfortunately, none of the venues have accessible parking. If you are driving to the venues, we recommend budgeting a generous amount of time to find parking. If you opt for public transport, please account for potential delays. It’s very important to us that folks are on time to the ceremony (3:45pm sharp!) in particular.</p>
            <br>

            <h3><em>What kind of food will be served?</em></h3>
            <p>We will be serving Filipino and Chinese-influenced New American cuisine with a focus on local, farm-to-table food. Please let us know of any dietary restrictions you may have so that you can enjoy the meal to its fullest.</p>
            <br>

            <h3><em>Will there be alcohol?</em></h3>
            <p>Yes, we will have a small selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages during the cocktail hour so that everyone can participate. If you elect to bring your own alcoholic beverage, you will be firmly asked to leave our gathering.</p>
            <br>

            <h3><em>Do I have to attend the after party?</em></h3>
            <p>No – only warm invitation, no obligation.</p>
            <br>

            <h3><em>What do you mean by “intimate and interactive” gathering?</em></h3>
            <p>We really want our community to learn more about one another and celebrate love. We appreciate the time, care, and intent you have all brought to the save-the-date questionnaire responses. We will use components of the questionnaire to create icebreaker-style materials for our ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner. Please reach out if you are curious about specific ways we are planning to do this!</p>
            <br>

            <h3><em>Can I take pictures during the wedding?</em></h3>
            <p>We really want everyone to be present in the moment. We’ll have a skilled and creative photographer (Anna Gillespie) and videographer (Emma Burke) documenting everything, so please keep phones and cameras away during the ceremony.</p>

I really love soup, and this recipe is especially warm and filling; best served with a soft-boiled egg. A close second is Anthony's lentil soup recipe that he sketched out and shared with me (pictured below) before we even met. I bought all of the ingredients for it the same day the I got the card in the mail.</td>

                        <td style="padding: 10px;"><p>The first times I felt especially loved were around the age 3, thanks to my mom and Auntie Elma.</p>
                            <p>My mom would braid my hair every single morning before preschool; even then I realized that my requests to have PERFECTLY braided hair EVERY morning were pretty high maintenance. I remember thinking something along the lines of "wow she must love me a lot" as I carried my brush and hair ties to her at 7am.</p>
                            <p>Another early instance of feeling loved left marks on me (physically, a scar on my right thumb, and in my conscience too). It was a late summer evening, and we were picking blackberries at the end of the road. I was very excited at the idea of blackberry treats, and though my mom and Uncle Larry both warned me not to run home with my hands full, I ran, and inevitably tripped and slammed into the ground. I crushed a bowl full of blackberries and somehow tore open my right thumb; the juices mixed with my blood. Mom and Uncle Larry issued a (warranted) "I told you so" while I stomped the rest of the way home screaming.</p>
                            <p>Auntie Elma sat me on the bathroom counter and cleaned out my thumb, equal parts exasperated and worried. She calmed me by yelling "DEEP BREATHS" to cool my screaming. She bandaged me up so gently and patiently, more kindly than I felt I deserved, and I felt safe and loved.   </p>

                        <td style="padding: 10px;"><p>This isn't the first time exactly, but it is the most vivid moment of my childhood. When I was 7, I became incredibly sick with a condition known as IPT where my white-blood cells were being destroyed by my spleen (autoimmune disorder). On Thanksgiving Day, my father drove me to the hospital in heavy snow (as we lived in Connecticut at the time) to the hospital to receive treatment. It was an intensive process with many weeks of blood transfusions, steroid boosters, and hospital food. Mid-way through my stay, my mother brought me the fifth Harry Potter book as it had just been released. During this time I couldn't do much except read and get well, but I have always cherished how loved I felt by both my parents during that difficult period of my life.</p>

                            <p>I love Anthony, my fresnel lens, directing my focus into the light, safety, and joy of our lives. He reminds me of where we're headed while illuminating what we have now.</p>
                            <p>I love how we still ask one another questions and maintain a commitment to curiosity of one another. I love how he finds a way to incorporate play and silliness into our lives, even with big life changes looming. I love how he Gets Shit Done: I love that I can trust him to follow through with projects or goals with integrity, initiative, and attention. I love how he is so generous and patient and gentle with me. I love how actively he creates space for me, how he takes me seriously and unseriously when I need it. I love how earnestly he reads my poetry even when he doesn't understand it.</p>
                            <p>I love how readily Anthony embraces the co-creation of our life together—one so wonderful, so full of joy, that it often surpasses anything I could have imagined dreaming for myself.</p>

                            <p>I love Mahal the most right now. She's everything that I have ever wanted from a life partner. Her wit and charm never fail to brighten my day and always manages to fix my sour mood. I'm constantly in awe of how she's able to approach things in a methodical and meticulous way, especially when it comes to the people in her life that she loves. She is unabashed about expressing concern and interest for the most important people in her life.</p>
                            <p>I love how Mahal holds me accountable and always believes in the best version of myself. I'm not perfect, and she accepts me for my flaws and my virtues. I think everyone who has had the privilege of having Mahal in their life can speak to how amazing she is.</p>
